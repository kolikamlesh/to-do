<h1>1. Choose a pivot element from the array (e.g., the first or last element).
2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: one with elements smaller than the pivot and another with elements larger than the pivot.
3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.
4. Combine the sorted sub-arrays to obtain the final sorted array.

Quicksort is known for its efficiency and is widely used in practice. However, it's worth mentioning that the worst-case time complexity of Quicksort is O(n^2) when the input is already sorted or nearly sorted. To mitigate this risk, you can use randomized Quicksort, where the pivot is chosen randomly, which reduces the chances of worst-case behavior.

Another alternative sorting algorithm to consider is **Mergesort**. Mergesort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases, including the worst case. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them, and then merging them back together. Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, mean</h1>
